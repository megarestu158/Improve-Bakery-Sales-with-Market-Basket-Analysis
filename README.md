# Improve-Bakery-Sales-with-Market-Basket-Analysis

Background<br>
A bakery is a business that makes and sells baked goods such as bread, cookies, cakes, and pastries. Some retail bakeries double as cafés, selling coffee and tea to customers who want to eat their baked goods on the spot. Businesses are constantly seeking for methods to improve their setup and boost sales. Bakeries are no different; one technique for increasing sales is to discover the association between items and consumers' mutual interests. Market basket analysis is one of the methods that can be used. When a consumer buys product A, market basket analysis looks at previous transaction data to uncover relationships or patterns so that we can recommend product B when they buy product A.
